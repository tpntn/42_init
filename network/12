# Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol 
#used to automate the process of configuring devices on IP networks, 
#thus allowing them to use network services such as DNS, NTP, 
#and any communication protocol based on UDP or TCP. 
#A DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address and other 
#network configuration parameters to each device on a network 
#so they can communicate with other IP networks.
